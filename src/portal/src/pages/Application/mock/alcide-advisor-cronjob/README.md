Alcide Advisor is an agentless service for Kubernetes audit and compliance thatâs built to ensure a frictionless and secured DevSecOps workflow by layering a hygiene scan of Kubernetes cluster & workloads early in the development process and before moving to production.

With Alcide Advisor, you can cover the following security checks:

- Kubernetes infrastructure vulnerability scanning.
- Hunting misplaced secrets, or excessive privileges for secret access.
- Workload hardening from Pod Security to network policies.
- Istio security configuration and best practices.
- Ingress Controllers for security best practices.
- Kubernetes API server access privileges.
- Kubernetes operators security best practices.
- Deployment conformance to labeling, annotating, resource limits and much more ...

## Pipeline Integrations

Alcide Kubernetes Advisor integration examples into CI+**CD** can be found in [alcideio/pipeline](https://github.com/alcideio/pipeline)

## Use Case Examples

### Hunting Misplaced Secrets, or Excessive Secret Access

The Kubernetes secret object is designed to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. Placing this information in plain text or in the wild (such as config maps) makes it easily exposed to unauthorized users, and is a greater risk for your Kubernetes and cloud provider environments.

Alcide Advisor scans for any secrets, API keys, and passwords that may have been wrongfully misplaced in pod environment variables, as well as in config maps. In addition, it verifies the use of RBAC permissions that defines who can read secret objects.

### Kubernetes Vulnerabilities Scan

While Kubernetes drastically simplifies the orchestration of your most sensitive containerized environments, itâs not bulletproof to critical security vulnerabilities that require quick detection and response.

An example of a serious vulnerability that was recently found is the privilege escalation vulnerability, tracked as [CVE-2018-1002105](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1002105). This vulnerability allows users, through a specially crafted request, to establish a connection through the Kubernetes API server and send arbitrary requests over the same connection directly to that backend. It was authenticated with the Kubernetes API serverâs TLS credentials that were used to establish the backend connection.

`Alcide Advisor` scans your cluster for known vulnerabilities on the master API server and worker node components, including container runtime. This has great benefit for teams using both managed clusters like Kops, AKS-Engine or the managed kubernetes services like AKS.

### App-Formation

The App-formation feature ([requires regsitration](https://www.alcide.io/advisor-free-trial/)) allows you to create a baseline profile on a specific cluster, and get scan results only on issues that deviate from the baseline. This helps DevOps focus on relevant issues and assets that require attention.
